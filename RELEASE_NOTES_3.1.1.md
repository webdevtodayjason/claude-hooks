# Release Notes - v3.1.1

## ðŸš€ Context Forge Integration - Enable Multi-Hour AI Development Workflows!

We're thrilled to announce the integration with **[Context Forge](https://github.com/webdevtodayjason/context-forge)**, solving one of the biggest challenges in AI-assisted development: context loss during extended coding sessions.

### The Problem
When working with Claude Code for extended periods, the context window fills up (typically every 2 hours) and performs "compaction". During this process, Claude forgets:
- Your project-specific rules and conventions
- Current implementation stage and progress
- PRP guidelines and specifications
- Bug tracking history

### The Solution
Our new Context Forge hooks provide automatic context recovery:
- **PreCompact Hook** - Detects Context Forge projects before compaction
- **Stop Hook** - Forces Claude to re-read critical files after compaction
- **Smart Detection** - Only activates for Context Forge projects
- **Zero Configuration** - Works automatically once installed

### Benefits
âœ… **8+ Hour Development Sessions** - Work all day without context loss  
âœ… **Automatic Recovery** - No manual reminders needed  
âœ… **Maintained Quality** - Consistent standards throughout  
âœ… **PRP Compliance** - Continuous adherence to specifications  

### Quick Setup

1. Install Context Forge:
```bash
npm install -g context-forge
```

2. Create a Context Forge project:
```bash
context-forge init
