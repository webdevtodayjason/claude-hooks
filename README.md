## üöÄ Game-Changing Feature: Context Forge Integration

### üåü Never Lose Context Again During Multi-Hour Development Sessions!

### üéâ First to Implement Anthropic's New PreCompact Hook!

We're excited to announce our groundbreaking integration with **[Context Forge](https://github.com/webdevtodayjason/context-forge)** - the industry-leading CLI tool for AI-ready project scaffolding. This integration is **the first implementation of Anthropic's brand new PreCompact hook**, announced in Claude Code v1.0.40, solving one of the biggest challenges in AI-assisted development: **context loss during conversation compaction**.

#### Why This is Revolutionary

**Anthropic's PreCompact hook** is a game-changing new feature that allows developers to:
- üîç **Intercept compaction events** before they happen
- üíæ **Preserve critical context** during the compaction process
- üîÑ **Automatically restore state** after compaction completes
- üöÄ **Enable truly continuous workflows** for the first time

We're among the **first to leverage this powerful new capability** from Anthropic, creating an integration that transforms how developers work with AI assistants.

#### What is Context Forge?

[Context Forge](https://github.com/webdevtodayjason/context-forge) is a powerful CLI tool that implements Andre Karpathy's context engineering principles to generate comprehensive documentation structures. It creates AI-optimized project scaffolds with:

- **CLAUDE.md** - Main context file with project rules and conventions
- **Docs/** - Structured implementation plans and documentation
- **PRPs/** - Product Requirement Prompts for detailed specifications
- **Validation Systems** - Built-in quality gates and checks

Install Context Forge:
```bash
npm install -g context-forge
```

Quick start a new project:
```bash
context-forge init
```

#### The Problem We Solve

During extended coding sessions, Claude Code's context window fills up and performs "compaction" to continue. This causes:
- üò∞ Loss of project-specific rules and conventions
- üîÑ Forgotten implementation stages and progress
- üìã Lost track of PRP guidelines and specifications
- üêõ Forgotten bug tracking and known issues

#### The Solution: Automatic Context Recovery

Our Context Forge hooks provide **automatic context recovery** after compaction using Anthropic's latest hook capabilities:

1. **PreCompact Hook** (New in Claude Code v1.0.40) - Intercepts compaction before it happens
2. **Smart Detection** - Automatically identifies projects with CLAUDE.md, Docs/, and PRPs/
3. **Context Restoration** - Forces Claude to re-read critical project files after compaction
4. **Progress Tracking** - Maintains awareness of current implementation stage

> **Technical Note**: The PreCompact hook is a brand new feature from Anthropic that was just released. It's the missing piece that finally makes multi-hour AI development sessions practical. By intercepting the compaction event *before* it happens, we can prepare instructions that ensure context is restored immediately after.

#### Benefits for Developers

- ‚úÖ **Multi-Hour Workflows** - Work on complex projects for 8+ hours without context loss
- ‚úÖ **Consistent Quality** - Maintain project standards throughout entire sessions
- ‚úÖ **Zero Manual Intervention** - Automatic context refresh, no reminders needed
- ‚úÖ **PRP Compliance** - Continuous adherence to Product Requirement Prompts
- ‚úÖ **Stage Awareness** - Always knows which implementation phase you're in

#### Setup Context Forge Integration

```bash
# Install Context Forge hooks
cd hooks/context-forge
./install-context-forge-hooks.sh

# Or manually add to ~/.claude/settings.json
```

## üéØ Dart Integration

Claude Hooks Manager now includes seamless integration with Dart MCP for project management. This feature enables automatic task tracking and documentation synchronization.

### What is Dart Integration?

Dart integration allows Claude to:
- Automatically suggest creating tasks in your Dart workspace
- Sync documentation between your local project and Dart
- Validate task creation with project-specific rules
- Generate CLAUDE.md files with workspace configuration

### Setting Up Dart Integration

#### Method 1: During Project Init
```bash
claude-hooks init
# When prompted, choose to set up Dart integration
```

#### Method 2: Direct Dart Setup
```bash
claude-hooks dart init
```

This will:
1. Create a `.dart` configuration file in your project root
2. Configure your Dart workspace, tasks folder, and docs folder
3. Optionally create a CLAUDE.md file with project instructions

### The .dart Configuration File

The `.dart` file stores your project's Dart workspace configuration:

```json
{
  "workspace": "MCP Forge",
  "tasksFolder": "MCP Forge/Tasks",
  "docsFolder": "MCP Forge/Docs",
  "syncEnabled": true,
  "syncRules": {
    "include": ["README.md", "docs/**/*.md", "wiki/**/*.md"],
    "exclude": [".github/**/*.md", "node_modules/**/*.md", "test/**/*.md"]
  }
}
```

### CLAUDE.md - Project Instructions

The `claude-hooks dart init` command can also generate a CLAUDE.md file that provides Claude with:
- Project-specific instructions
- Dart workspace configuration
- Task management rules
- Git workflow guidelines
- Development best practices

### Disabling Dart Features

If you're not using Dart, you can:

1. **Skip during setup**: Choose "No" when asked about Dart integration
2. **Disable sync**: Set `"syncEnabled": false` in your `.dart` file
3. **Remove configuration**: Delete the `.dart` file from your project
4. **Disable hooks**: Run `claude-hooks disable sync-docs-to-dart` and `claude-hooks disable validate-dart-task`

### How It Works

1. **sync-docs-to-dart hook**: 
   - Triggers when you create/edit markdown files
   - Checks for `.dart` configuration
   - If no config exists, prompts you to run `claude-hooks dart init`
   - If configured, suggests syncing to your Dart docs folder

2. **validate-dart-task hook**:
   - Triggers when creating Dart tasks
   - Suggests using your project's configured dartboard
   - Validates task priorities and statuses

### Customizing CLAUDE.md

See [CLAUDE.md.template](./CLAUDE.md.template) for a complete guide on customizing your project instructions. The template includes:
- Variable references
- Common customizations
- Best practices
- Example configurations

Click on any hook below to see detailed information about what it does and how it helps your development workflow.

<details>
<summary><strong>üöÄ precompact-context-refresh.py</strong> - First Implementation of Anthropic's PreCompact Hook</summary>

### What it does:
This groundbreaking hook is the **first implementation of Anthropic's new PreCompact hook event** (released in Claude Code v1.0.40), enabling multi-hour AI development sessions:
- üéØ **Uses Anthropic's PreCompact event** to intercept before compaction occurs
- üîç Detects Context Forge projects (CLAUDE.md, Docs/, PRPs/)
- üìä Tracks current implementation stage from transcript
- üíæ Creates marker for post-compaction recovery
- üìù Prepares detailed refresh instructions

### Why it's revolutionary:
Before Anthropic released the PreCompact hook, there was no way to prepare for compaction events. Now, for the first time, we can:
- **Intercept compaction before it happens** (impossible before v1.0.40)
- **Preserve critical state information** during the compaction process
- **Ensure immediate context recovery** after compaction completes

This is a game-changer for AI-assisted development, finally making 8+ hour coding sessions practical and productive.

### Technical implementation:
```python
# This hook receives the new PreCompact event from Claude Code
# Event data includes: session_id, transcript_path, trigger, custom_instructions
def main():
    input_data = json.load(sys.stdin)  # PreCompact event from Anthropic
    # ... detect Context Forge project and prepare recovery
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>üîÑ stop-context-refresh.py</strong> - Automatic Context Restoration</summary>

### What it does:
Works in tandem with the PreCompact hook to restore context after compaction:
- ‚úÖ Detects when compaction has occurred
- üìö Forces Claude to re-read all critical project files
- üéØ Maintains awareness of current implementation stage
- üí° Provides specific instructions based on project structure

### Why it's helpful:
Eliminates the frustrating need to manually remind Claude about your project after each compaction. Your workflow continues seamlessly, maintaining quality and consistency throughout extended development sessions.

### Integration with Context Forge:
This hook specifically looks for Context Forge project structures and customizes the refresh instructions based on what files exist in your project, ensuring maximum context recovery with minimum overhead.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>üîç pre-commit-validator.py</strong> - Your Safety Net Before Commits</summary>

### What it does:
This hook acts as your personal quality assurance assistant. Before any code gets committed, it automatically:
- ‚úÖ Runs your test suite to catch broken functionality
- ‚úÖ Executes linting tools to ensure code style consistency
- ‚úÖ Performs TypeScript type checking to prevent type errors
- ‚úÖ Validates that your code meets project standards

### Why it's helpful:
Imagine pushing code only to find out later that tests are failing or there are linting errors. This hook prevents that embarrassment by catching issues before they reach the repository. It's like having a careful reviewer check your work every time.

### Example output:
```
üîç Running pre-commit validation...
‚úÖ Tests passed (42 tests, 0 failures)
‚úÖ Linting passed (0 errors, 0 warnings)
‚úÖ TypeScript check passed
‚ú® All checks passed! Ready to commit.
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>‚úèÔ∏è validate-git-commit.py</strong> - Commit Message Police</summary>

### What it does:
This hook ensures all commit messages follow a consistent format:
- üìè Enforces minimum message length (10+ characters)
- üî§ Requires capitalized first letter
- üö´ Blocks co-authored commits (no auto-generated attributions)
- üìù Ensures conventional commit format when configured

### Why it's helpful:
Good commit messages make project history readable and searchable. This hook ensures everyone on the team writes clear, consistent commit messages that explain what changed and why.

### Example:
```
‚ùå Bad: "fix bug"
‚úÖ Good: "Fix navigation menu overflow on mobile devices"
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>üóÑÔ∏è database-extension-check.py</strong> - Database Schema Guardian</summary>

### What it does:
Prevents developers from creating unnecessary new database tables when they could extend existing ones:
- üîç Detects when you're creating new migration files
- üí° Suggests existing tables that might be extended instead
- üìä Encourages proper database normalization
- üö´ Blocks creation of duplicate or redundant tables

### Why it's helpful:
Keeps your database clean and maintainable by preventing table sprawl. Instead of having users, user_profiles, user_settings, and user_preferences as separate tables, it encourages you to use a single users table with appropriate columns.

### Example:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  Creating new table 'user_settings'
üí° Consider extending the existing 'users' table instead
   You could add a 'settings' JSON column or related fields
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>üîÅ duplicate-detector.py</strong> - Code Duplication Police</summary>

### What it does:
Scans your codebase to prevent creating duplicate:
- üõ£Ô∏è API routes (e.g., two `/api/users` endpoints)
- üß© React/Vue components with the same name
- üì¶ Utility functions that already exist
- üìÑ Similar file names that might cause confusion

### Why it's helpful:
Duplication leads to maintenance nightmares. This hook helps maintain the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle by alerting you when similar code already exists.

### Example:
```
‚ùå Duplicate detected!
   You're creating: components/UserCard.tsx
   Already exists: components/user/UserCard.tsx
üí° Consider using the existing component or choosing a different name
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>üé® style-consistency.py</strong> - Style & Theme Enforcer</summary>

### What it does:
Ensures consistent styling across your application:
- üåì Enforces dark mode support (checks for dark: variants)
- üé® Prevents hardcoded colors (use theme variables instead)
- üß© Suggests ShadCN UI components over raw HTML elements
- üìè Validates spacing uses consistent scale (2, 4, 6, 8, etc.)

### Why it's helpful:
Maintains a professional, consistent look across your entire application. No more random colors or inconsistent spacing that makes your app look unprofessional.

### Example:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  Style issues found:
   Line 23: Missing dark mode variant for bg-blue-500
   Line 45: Use ShadCN Button component instead of <button>
   Line 67: Hardcoded color #3B82F6 - use theme variables
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>üåê api-endpoint-verifier.py</strong> - API Standards Enforcer</summary>

### What it does:
Validates that all API endpoints follow best practices:
- üîê Ensures authentication is implemented
- üìù Checks for proper input validation
- üè∑Ô∏è Enforces consistent naming conventions
- ‚ö° Validates error handling is in place

### Why it's helpful:
Prevents security vulnerabilities and ensures a consistent API experience for consumers. No more endpoints that work differently or have security holes.

### Example:
```
‚ùå API endpoint issues:
   /api/getUser - Should use REST convention: GET /api/users/:id
   Missing authentication check
   No input validation for user ID
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>üìö api-docs-enforcer.py</strong> - API Documentation Guardian</summary>

### What it does:
Ensures every API endpoint is properly documented:
- üìã Requires Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for all endpoints
- üìÆ Enforces Postman collection updates
- üîê Validates security documentation for internal APIs
- üîó Ensures documentation links between Swagger and Postman

### Why it's helpful:
Good API documentation is crucial for team collaboration and API consumers. This hook ensures no endpoint goes undocumented, making your API easy to understand and use.

### Example:
```
‚ùå API Documentation Required:
   New endpoint: POST /api/users/bulk-import
   Missing from swagger.json
   No Postman collection entry
   
üí° Run 'npm run generate-api-docs' to auto-generate documentation
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>üö´ no-mock-code.py</strong> - Real Code Enforcer</summary>

### What it does:
Prevents placeholder or mock code from entering production:
- üìù Detects Lorem ipsum text
- üë§ Flags test users (John Doe, test@example.com)
- üîÑ Identifies functions that always return the same value
- üìå Catches TODO comments without implementation
- üíæ Finds hardcoded test data

### Why it's helpful:
Ensures your production code uses real, dynamic data. No more embarrassing moments where "John Doe" appears in production or where a function always returns the same test data.

### Example:
```
‚ùå Mock/Placeholder Code Detected!
   Line 45: Found "Lorem ipsum" - Replace with real content
   Line 67: Static user data - Implement database query
   Line 89: TODO without implementation - Complete the function
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>üîí secret-scanner.py</strong> - Security Guardian</summary>

### What it does:
Scans code for accidentally exposed secrets:
- üîë Detects API keys and tokens
- üîê Finds passwords and credentials
- üìß Identifies private keys and certificates
- üö® Checks .gitignore includes sensitive files

### Why it's helpful:
Prevents the #1 security mistake: committing secrets to version control. Once a secret is in Git history, it's compromised forever. This hook is your last line of defense.

### Example:
```
üö® CRITICAL: Attempting to commit secrets!
   Line 23: API key detected: sk_test_abc...
   Line 45: Hardcoded password found
   
‚ùå Commit blocked - remove secrets and use environment variables
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>üîÑ env-sync-validator.py</strong> - Environment Config Keeper</summary>

### What it does:
Keeps your environment configuration files synchronized:
- üìã Ensures .env.example is updated when .env changes
- üí° Suggests safe placeholder values for examples
- üö´ Prevents real secrets in .env.example
- üìù Validates all team members know required variables

### Why it's helpful:
When team members pull your code, they need to know what environment variables to set. This hook ensures .env.example always reflects the current requirements.

### Example:
```
‚ùå Environment sync issues:
   New variable DATABASE_URL in .env
   Missing from .env.example
   
üí° Add to .env.example:
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/dbname
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>üöÆ gitignore-enforcer.py</strong> - Repository Cleanliness Guard</summary>

### What it does:
Ensures .gitignore is properly configured:
- üìÅ Verifies .gitignore exists
- üö´ Blocks commits of sensitive files (.env, *.key, *.pem)
- üß™ Prevents test scripts and temporary files
- üíæ Stops large files and backups from being committed

### Why it's helpful:
Keeps your repository clean and secure. Prevents accidentally committing files that should never be in version control, like private keys, large binaries, or temporary files.

### Example:
```
üö® FORBIDDEN FILES detected:
   ‚Ä¢ .env (environment file)
   ‚Ä¢ private-key.pem (private key)
   ‚Ä¢ test-script.sh (test script)
   
üí° Add these patterns to .gitignore:
   .env
   *.pem
   *test-script*
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>üìù readme-update-validator.py</strong> - Documentation Reminder</summary>

### What it does:
Reminds you to update documentation when code changes:
- üÜï Detects new features and APIs
- üìö Suggests README sections to update
- üîß Identifies configuration changes
- üì¶ Notices new dependencies

### Why it's helpful:
Documentation often becomes outdated because developers forget to update it. This hook provides gentle reminders to keep your README current with your code.

### Example:
```

## Configuration

### Global Hook Configuration

Hooks are configured in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [...],
    "PostToolUse": [...],
    "Stop": [...]
  }
}
```

See `settings.example.json` for the complete configuration.

### Project-Specific Configuration

Some hooks now support project-specific configuration to avoid cross-project interference:

#### Session End Summary Hook
Create `.claude/session-summary.json` in your project:
```json
{
  "show_dart_reminders": true,
  "show_git_reminders": true,
  "custom_reminders": [
    "Run tests before committing",
    "Update documentation"
  ]
}
```

#### Documentation Sync Hook
Create `.claude/dart-config.json` in your project:
```json
{
  "enable_doc_sync": true,
  "default_docs_folder": "workspace/Docs",
  "workspace": "your-workspace",
  "dartboard": "workspace/Tasks"
}
```

See [Project-Aware Hooks Documentation](docs/project-aware-hooks.md) for detailed configuration options.

## Customization

### Disable a Hook
Edit `~/.claude/settings.json` and remove or comment out the specific hook entry.

### Add Custom Hooks
See our comprehensive [Developing Custom Hooks Guide](docs/developing-custom-hooks.md) for detailed instructions.

Quick start:
1. Create a Python script in `~/.claude/hooks/`
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x your-hook.py`
3. Add it to the appropriate section in `settings.json`

### Hook Exit Codes
- `0` - Success, continue normally
- `2` - Blocking error, prevents tool execution
- Other - Non-blocking error, shows message but continues

## Best Practices

1. **Performance** - Keep hooks fast to avoid slowing down Claude
2. **Error Handling** - Always handle exceptions gracefully
3. **Clear Messages** - Provide actionable feedback
4. **Non-Blocking** - Use warnings for suggestions, only block on critical issues

## Troubleshooting

### Hooks Not Running
1. Restart Claude after installation
2. Check `~/.claude/settings.json` is valid JSON
3. Verify hook files are executable

### Disabled Hook Errors
If you're seeing "No such file or directory" errors for disabled hooks:

**Problem**: When hooks are disabled using older versions, Claude still tries to execute them, causing errors.

**Solution**: Run the migration script to update disabled hooks to the new format:
```bash
node migrate-disabled-hooks.js
```

This converts disabled hooks to use stub files that exit cleanly, preventing errors while keeping hooks disabled.

**How it works**:
- Instead of renaming hooks to `.disabled`, the new system:
  - Moves the original hook to `.py.original`
  - Creates a stub `.py` file that exits cleanly
  - Claude can still find and execute the hook, but it does nothing

### Testing Hooks
```bash
echo '{"tool_name":"Bash","tool_input":{"command":"test"}}' | python3 ~/.claude/hooks/hook-name.py
```

## Log Files

- `~/.claude/bash-command-log.txt` - All bash commands
- `~/.claude/hooks/commands-YYYY-MM-DD.log` - Daily command logs
- `~/.claude/hooks/command-stats.json` - Command frequency stats
- `~/.claude/hooks/pending-dart-syncs.json` - Pending doc syncs
